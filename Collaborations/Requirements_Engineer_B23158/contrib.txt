As the assigned Requirements Engineer, i first researched around and found out the necessary and compliant Requirements for our system.
Then i prepared the Requirements Documentation (the /reports/Requirements_doc_G17.pdf) which was followed throughout the project's lifecycle

After that my major part was in ensuring that all the code pieces as well as tests were in place (screenshots of chats and commits attached)
For more proof-of-work, one can see the Github Repository for this project.
