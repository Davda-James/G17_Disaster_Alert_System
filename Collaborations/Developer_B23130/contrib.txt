After the initial implementation by Avirup(dev team), which supported only SMS alerts, I added mail-alert functionality and expanded the alert system to improve delivery reliability. During this enhancement, I found that both SMS and email messages were not retried after a single failed attempt. To address this, I designed and implemented a round-based retry mechanism where failed deliveries are queued and retried in subsequent rounds, with configurable retry limits. Overall, these improvements significantly increased the reliability of SMS and email delivery.
