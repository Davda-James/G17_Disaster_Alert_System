As the Lead Tester for the Disaster Alert System (DAS), I successfully executed and validated a comprehensive test suite of 109 tests, achieving a 100% pass rate across all modules. My testing strategy employed a Risk-Based Testing (RBT) approach, prioritizing critical failure modes such as SMS gateway outages and database corruption, all of which were handled gracefully by the system's safety mechanisms. I verified the system's core logic through 88 backend tests, covering functional alerting, stress testing under burst loads (processing 100+ alerts in under 2 seconds), and precise boundary value analysis for geographical and threshold inputs. On the frontend, I validated the user experience with 21 component and authentication tests, ensuring robust error handling and session persistence. This rigorous validation process, confirmed by a code coverage of 89.76%, certifies that the DAS is stable, resilient, and fully ready for production deployment.  The same can be seen through the "Piyush" branch of the github repo and its commits
