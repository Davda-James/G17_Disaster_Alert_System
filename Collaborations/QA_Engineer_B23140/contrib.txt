I worked on this project as a Quality Assurance Engineer, where I reviewed backend and frontend code changes, verified functionality after feature additions, and validated integrations across authentication, database, geolocation, and SMS services. I tested critical user flows such as signup, login, alert creation, and radius-based SMS delivery, and ensured that duplicate alert suppression worked as intended. I also reviewed and merged pull requests after confirming stability and correctness of changes. In addition, I created the User Guide for the project to document application usage and deployment steps, ensuring the system is easy to understand, run, and evaluate.
